// Callen Dye
// Program 3 starter code
// Starter Code By: James Cain (jcain@sbuniv.edu)
// This is the required starter code for this assignment.
// Assignment Description:
// Read the following Java API descriptions:
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/PrintStream.html
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
// java.sun.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
// Correct the information leakage problem(s) in the Java code
// provided. Correct any other problems in the code and make
// sure your code cannot be crashed by any particular choices of
// user input, including obviously erroneous input.
// Algorithmic Description:
// Whoever wrote this program should have told you what it does.
// If you really cannot understand what this code does and
// therefore cannot do the assignment, see your professor in their office and ask your professor to
// explain it to you and he will.
// Last comment: Don't you wish this wasn't the last comment?
